#Notes:
- for a randomizers page generate the number of text boxes equal to the size of entryList

- have each text box call EditRandomizer on text change to update list

- have x button to delete that entry next to each text box

- have single add entry button that will add blank entry in list, therefore creating blank textbox

- have the save button remove all blank entries in list
